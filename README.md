# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project: Medallion Architecture Implementation

## 📌 Executive Summary
This project demonstrates the end-to-end transformation of raw, fragmented data into a high-performance **Star Schema** data warehouse. By implementing a **Medallion Architecture**, I have automated the data cleansing process, ensured referential integrity, and built a suite of advanced analytical reports. 

The final output provides the business with a "Single Source of Truth," enabling data-driven decisions regarding customer segmentation, product performance, and long-term sales trends.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture



### 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)
* **Purpose:** To ingest raw data from multiple sources (CRM and ERP systems) in its original format.
* **Action:** Created tables to store raw data without transformations to ensure data lineage.

### 2. Silver Layer (Cleansing & Standardization)
* **Purpose:** To transform "dirty" raw data into clean, usable formats.
* **Key Tasks:** Handling nulls, standardizing genders (Male/Female), and date formatting.

### 3. Gold Layer (Business Logic & Star Schema)
* **Purpose:** To structure data for high-speed reporting using **Dimension** and **Fact** tables.
* **Key Tasks:** Enforcing Foreign Key Integrity and building analytical views.

## 🔍 Analytical Modules

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Comprehensive profiling of the database to understand data distributions:
* **Metadata Inventory:** Automated checks using `information_schema`.
* **Health Checks:** Verifying data spans (first/last order dates) and unique record counts.

### 📈 Advanced Analytical Project
Implemented complex SQL logic to track business health:
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Tracking sales trends and seasonality.
* **Cumulative Growth:** Running totals and moving averages to visualize business trajectory.
* **Benchmarking:** Comparing current product sales against historical averages using `LAG` and `OVER` functions.

## 📘 Data Dictionary: Analytical Reports

### 1. Customer Report (`report_customers`)
| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `customer_key` | Unique identifier for the customer. |
| `customer_name` | Full name of the customer (Concatenated). |
| `age_group` | Categorization based on birthdate (e.g., 20-29, 30-39). |
| `customer_segment` | Logic-based grouping: **VIP**, **Regular**, or **New**. |
| `recency` | Number of months since the customer's last purchase. |
| `total_sales` | Total revenue generated by the customer. |
| `lifespan` | Months between the customer's first and last purchase. |
| `avg_order_value` | Average amount spent per transaction. |

### 2. Product Report (`report_products`)
| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `product_name` | Name of the product. |
| `category` | High-level grouping (e.g., Bikes, Clothing). |
| `product_segment` | Performance tier: **High-Performer**, **Mid-Range**, or **Low-Performer**. |
| `total_orders` | Number of unique orders containing this product. |
| `total_customers` | Number of unique customers who purchased this product. |
| `avg_selling_price` | Average price the product was sold for (Revenue / Quantity). |
| `avg_monthly_revenue` | Revenue divided by the product's lifespan in months. |

## 🚀 Key Insights Generated
* **Revenue Drivers:** Identified the specific products and subcategories that generate the highest volume of sales.
* **Customer Loyalty:** Segmented the customer base to distinguish high-value "VIPs" from one-time "New" buyers.
* **Seasonality:** Pinpointed peak sales months to align marketing efforts with high-demand periods.
* **Product Performance:** Discovered "Low-Performer" products that have high costs but low sales frequency.
* **Growth Trends:** Validated the business growth trajectory using year-over-year sales comparisons.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Architecture:** Medallion (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
* **SQL Techniques:** CTEs, Window Functions (`RANK`, `LAG`), Joins, and Views.

## 🎓 Acknowledgments & Credits

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to **Data with Baara** for the incredible [SQL Full Course for Beginners (30 Hours) – From Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaara). 

This project was built step-by-step under his expert guidance. Through this course, I mastered:
* **The Medallion Architecture:** Implementing Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
* **Advanced SQL Logic:** Mastering Window Functions, CTEs, and Data Modeling.
* **Analytical Thinking:** Learning how to transform raw data into a "Business Story."

His teaching methodology was the bridge that allowed me to move from "Zero" to a "Hero" level of proficiency in SQL and Data Engineering.
